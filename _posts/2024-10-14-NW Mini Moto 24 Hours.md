# Report

I had a great time racing with Team Crazy Turtles in the inaugural 24 hours of minis with NorthWest Mini Moto & Endurance Challenge.

We made it through with one minor crash and no mechanical issues which helped us finish with a +32 lap gap to the team in second. 

Thanks to Petro Ksondzyk for providing and prepping the bike, and to the rest of the team for putting on an excellent performance Andrey Ulanov, Devin Husband, Brenden Ketelsen. 

Also. Itâ€™s a good thing this race ended when it did. We very much were at the end of the front tire.
