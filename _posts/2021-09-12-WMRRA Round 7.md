# Report:

Well, the last round of WMRRA 2021 is complete. It was at Pacific Raceways, much
fun was had, and both of the Short Fuse Racing novices have graduated and entered
the fold of expert racers.

## Saturday

While we race at better tracks, Pacific Raceways has a special place in my heart.
It was the first race track I rode a motorcycle on, it has the feel of a back
country road, and it has a flow that the other tracks we ride at can't quite
match. Sure, there is limited runoff, a blackberry patch you can toss your bike
into, and a bit more airfence than I'd like, but I love it nonetheless.


## Qualifying
Without a track day to run myself and the bike in a bit, I was expecting to
have a mediocre qualifying performance. It wasn't the worst, but I was only able
to manage 3rd and 4th row starts. My starts are good though, so I figure this 
is alright.

## 600 SS
My first race of the weekend is 600SS. I got a great start, but definitely overslowed
turn 2. Some folks get around but I slot in. I spend the race with Zac Smith just
in front. I tried to get around a few times but Zac had my number. For good
measure Matthew White was also on my butt. He passed me no less than 3 times into
the bus stop and made me work for my finishing place in front of him.

## 600 SBK
600 SBK was shockingly like 600SS. I got a good start, Zac Smith was in front
of me, and I saw Matthew Smiths wheel more than I'd like to. For those wondering
the number of times I'd like to see his wheel. Zero. #Goals.

## Sunday:
There was rain forecasted for the early morning, but I figured, as I think most
of the paddock did, that it would dry up for race time. Well... We were wrong.

I had left my rains at home, which was mistake one. Though my novice Hunter
had agreed, very graciously, to let me go out on his rain prepped R6 for
qualifying. Unfortunately Hunter ran into a problem with shifting and I wasn't
able to take advantage of his generosity. I gridded by points, which put me at
the front of the folks that didn't go on track. That wasn't as bad I figured it
would be so maybe that was a lucky break.

Unfortunately, as stated above, the rain didn't really stop. As I didn't want
two sets of rains, even though I am sure my good friend Kumpy Kump at Kump Racing
would have been happy to help me out, I decided not to race on my slicks.

I stayed around to watch the novices race their last round of 2021 and of course
by then the pavement had dried up; the irony here being that Hunter Fitch, my
novice, left his rains on. He wasn't going to be surprised by some rain, that
is for sure.

It was a solid season of racing with some ups and down. On the positive my bike
and I are in good shape and I am thinking about next season already. Thanks to
my wife, my Short Fuse Teammates. Track Time and Ken Hill for the support,
Kumpy Kump for the sticky tires, and the entire WMRRA club and volunteers.

See y'all in 2022.
