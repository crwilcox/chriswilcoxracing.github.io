# Report:



I only make it down to Portland once a season typically. This season had more
rounds down south, but the schedule didn't work well with my other events this
year, so again I made it down for the July round. You'd think I learned my
lesson last year with the heat, but I came back anyway. It was cooler than
last year, but it was still a scorcher.

Originally I was planning to come down for the Friday practice day, but it
wasn't in the cards, I arrived in Portland around 9 PM Friday and got setup to
go in the AM.

## Saturday
When the morning came, I got to work. Being a year since I was last on track at
PIR meant some getting reacquainted was in order. I wasn't quite up to last
seasons pace by the end of practice, but I felt like I mostly had my way around
figured out. I usually find additional time come racing.

OMRRA, the host of our PIR rounds, runs a very similar schedule both days; a 
600SS and 600SBK event each day.
I took to the grid for 600SS and got a reasonably good start. The chicane can
be a bit of a jam point so getting off the line and keeping your elbows out on
the start is important. When I came into turn 3 though red flags were showing.
It turns out 4 bikes had went down due to a rider coming in to the chicane
rather hot... ([video](https://youtu.be/36KBvUJho74))

We'd get a restart and I was able to again get a solid start. I finished the
race in 7th place and was back to my personal best times, 1:21.6.

The weather really began to heat up as we headed later into the day.

Fortunately Louis Stevenson, my pit mate and photographer extraordinaire, brings
a freezer with treats. Otter pops hit different when you are baking in the hot
sun.

I was hoping to build on my SS performance in SBK. My start was alright but
the chicane turned into a parking lot. I ended up getting backed up. I would
spend most of my race trying to work my way back up the grid. I'd finish in 10th.

## Sunday

Sunday was a cooler day which was welcome. I felt good in practice.

I started again with 600SS and unfortunately the start was a bit like the last
race of the day prior; the chicane was a bit jammed up. I wasn't really able to
improve my times on Saturday, but I felt I could find a bit more pace.

Betwen my two events my teammate was in the Formula 40 race. He rides a Kramer 890
and, in a race of 1000cc Superbikes, he is a bit outgunned. Rather than stress
it, we tried to make the pit mood light. We cranked the music, joked around,
and just didn't worry too much. I had arranged to pull a bit of a joke on him
as well. When he entered hot pit, I was standing there with an umbrella. It's
hot out here, who doesn't need some shade?

Going into 600SBK, I was able to get an alright start. I spent the laps reeling
in two riders that were in touch in front of me. As I clicked off the laps my
times were coming down. I had again got about to my personal best times and
thought, I have a bit more. One of the more important corners on the track is T4.
It's the start of the back straight and I thought if I could get turned a bit
earlier, exit sooner, I could elongate it and find a bit of my laptime.

While entering the corner it seems I overdid it. I tucked the front wheel and
the bike and I took a light tumble. I am not much of a crasher. The last solo
crash I had was in August of 2018. I got a bit ambitious and sometimes you find
the limit.

## Summary

It was a great weekend with great company, even with the crash. I am impressed
with the gear I am using these days and how safe it keeps me. Suit Airbags are 
amazing, and my KYT helmet did its job in full. I am writing this report post
round with a small shoulder bruise and a larger bruised ego. Having quality
safety equipment makes it easier to take risks on track as I know it is there
to protect me.

Thanks to Louis Stevenson for taking the photos and providing treats, as well
as making a great pitmate. Thanks to Colin Carihill for sharing a van down to
Portland from Seattle. And thanks to Dave Pearce for loaning out his pimped out
sprinter for us to hang out in style this weekend.

The race schedule this year means we have a gap so plenty of time for me to fix
the bike and prepare mentally to go out there again. Luckily, I have a TrackTime
event Monday-Tuesday July 24-25 and am going to be able to shake off the crash
quick.
