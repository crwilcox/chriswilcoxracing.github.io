It was a solid weekend for our first race round at Pacific of the season. The pit had quite the haul of podiums on the weekend. I was able to manage 2 for 4 races I entered.

## Saturday

I don't do many laps at Pacific, so everytime we race here it's a bit like drinking from a firehose. Luckily, I think the same thing is true for most others.

### Race 5 - MW SBK

MW SBK started with a solid start, but the immediate feeling was "Wow, I don't know this track as well as I should". I was able to get off the line into 2nd, but it took Oli little time to put me in third, and only a bit more time after that for Kevin to get by. From there it was a pretty lonely race in 4th place.

### Race 10 - MW GP

I got a stellar start again in MW GP, but by the end of the first lap, Kevin got a better exit out of the bus stop. I then spent the race working to catch up, but my laptimes were just a hair slower than Kevin was putting down. My laps were faster than the first race though, and progress is good.

### Awards

The first race of Sunday was MW SBK again. I had an uncharacteristic bad start. I popped a wheelie when the light went out and had to gather it back up. I spent the ENTIRE race in 4th place

### Race 22 - 450 SBK

I don't know what it was about Sunday, but my start for 450 SBK was also not very good. Still, I got into turn 2 in 4th place. I fought to claw my way into 3rd in the first few laps. Towards the end, Dave Oster put a good pass on me into the bus stop but it compromised his drive and I was able to use his slip stream to get back around through turn 1. I then turned it up for the rest of the race to ensure he stayed behind.
