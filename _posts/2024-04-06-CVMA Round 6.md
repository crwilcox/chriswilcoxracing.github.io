# Report:

Like last year I started my season off by a road trip to the middle of the desert. The Desert Center, if you will. This is my second visit to Chuckwalla and it was once again a heck of a good time.

I was able to get up to speed a bit faster than last time thanks to not being the first visit. Chuckwalla is unique to the tracks I race at as it is really rewards roll speed. This is part of why I like coming down. It helps me to work on things that I don't really work on in the Pacific Northwest. By the end of Friday my laptimes were pretty on par with the times I was running last year.

I'd have two races each day which worked out to be a reasonable amount of track time. I'm a pretty good starter and I knew what I was getting into. The Chuckwalla starting grid gets pretty crowded but I knew this coming in which helped remove some hesitation from how I start as well.

While my overall results aren't too impressive, I was running far better times, far more consistently. The next closest racer was 4 seconds a lap faster from the group I was at the front of so I'll need to find the next leap forward on my own.

I'm glad I took the time to take this journey and to go to YCRS before we start in earnest in the Pacific Northwest for OMRRA/WMRRA. I'm hoping that this helps me make another advancement in my riding.
