# Report:

We had another wet weekend in the PNW. Of course, in classic WA fashion, it couldn't decide whether to be dry or not. I didn't manage any podiums this time around but I am still very happy with my results. 

The first race on Saturday was Clubman and it wasn't my best result. I just wasn't able to match the speed of the guys at the front. The second race, 600 SuperSport wasn’t too bad and I managed an 11th with a lap time of 1:37.171 which is pretty good for me. I am making improvements each time I am out there.

Sunday brought amazing racing and challenges. 600 Classic SBK was one heck of a fight! Keith Stone and I fought from the beginning to the end. I led most of the laps, but he edged me out in the final corners and took 3rd place. Congrats Keith! You were in front on the only lap that matters. Clubman on Sunday was a different story. I got a great start but I ended up having some pretty bad vision problems and was half-blind going around the track. I had no confidence to make passes and just ended up slowing up and lapping to bring it home. I would have liked to have done better but sometimes you do as well as you can.

Thank you to the entire WMRRA family for the weekend. And congrats to the Novices for enduring some nasty nasty conditions, especially for their races. Also thanks to my wife Anna Piechowski for sitting in the cold with me all weekend. And thanks to my sponsor Shorai Inc.. Even though it was in the 50s my bike fired up strong every time!
