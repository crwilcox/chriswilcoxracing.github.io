# Report:

Going to keep this report short.

It was great to get out at the Ridge, it always is, for a couple of Races. I
was able to set quality best laps in the 1:52's which is going for me. I also
had some added excitement before F600. My Battery had drained and the bike
wouldn't crank. Thanks to my teammate Colin I got the best [bump start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbDeqbdWt8) and was able to get out for the race.
