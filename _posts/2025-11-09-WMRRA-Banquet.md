I attended the WMRRA 2025 Banquet last night and received trophies for taking 1st in Middleweight GP and 2nd in 450 SBK this season. I am grateful for having this club to race with in Washington and the grid of competitors that shows up. All season long I had to battle with a number of very talented riders, which makes it mean that much more.

The year begain with a *really* bad incident in March. I was laid up and my motorcycle was *not race worthy*. The first race round I rode with a very second hand looking motorcycle and some not-insignificant pain from the crash and managed to get on the box.

I did my all to keep that going all season. I battled hard against very capable competitors the whole way across three race circuits. This is my first championship win in a decade of racing, here's to hoping it's not the last.

Thanks to Track Time, CT Racing, KYT Americas, Short Circuit Racing, and everyone who supports me.
