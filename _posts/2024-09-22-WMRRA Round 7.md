# Report:

I decided to focus on the RS660, MW SBK/MW GP Classes this round at Pacific Raceways.

The difficult bits:
- I've still not had much time on this bike.
- I don't ride at Pacific Raceways very much so I needed to sort out the specifics of the track,
  update references, especially since last time I was here they didn't have the blue barriers.
- My qualifying got scrubbed due to some other event red flags. They gridded us on points.

The Positives:
- While I was low on points, I had a good first round on the bike, so I was starting mid pack.

I managed a 1st, 3rd, and 2nd on the weekend. The rider in front of me in two of the events set lap records in both events and was flying, so 2nd was a respectable result. 

Thanks to my wife for supporting me and for all of my sponsors. KYT, Pirelli, Track Time.
