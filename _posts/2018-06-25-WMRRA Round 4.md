# Report:
Round 4 was the first round this season at Pacific Raceways. I always enjoy this track. The back straight has a close tree line and some technical corners that really flow together. Also, unlike The Ridge, the pavement here is old; there are bumps and less grippy spots. I know a lot of riders dislike this but it brings a different challenge.

I raced in 4 races, 2 each day, and was able to improve across the weekend. I am still a bit off of my best times at the track of 1:33.910 but I managed a 01:35.968. Unfortunately this is the only Pacific Raceways event I will be attending this year so I won't have a chance to improve on my times.

The highlight of the weekend was definitely Clubman Qualifier on Sunday. Jason Pierce and I had some close riding for most of the race. CJ Hobbs made an appearance but with the power of a new R1 he was a rocket ship on the straight. Here is to hoping to more close racing with the Shire.
