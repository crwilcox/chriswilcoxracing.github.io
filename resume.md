Chris Wilcox is a regional road racer that started his career in 2015. He primarily races in the [WMRRA](https://wmrra.com) (Washington Motorcycle Road Racing Association) and [OMRRA](https://omrra.com) (Oregon Motorcycle Road Racing Association) racing series. Aboard his 2017 Yamaha R6, he can be found on the grids of the top-level 600 cc classes; Formula 600, 600 Supersport, and 600 Superbike classes. 

Chris is involved in the Pacific Northwest motorcycle community. He has served as an executive board member of WMRRA (2nd VP), technical inspector for WMRRA, and an active community member. You can find him most WMRRA race weekends at Friday night tech, making sure machinery and gear are in order for the weekend's events.

When not racing Chris works with [Track Time](https://tracktime.bike/), a premier track day provider in Washington State owned and operated by [Ken Hill](http://khcoaching.com/) and Alan Schwen, to grow riders in the Pacific Northwest.
