I've had folks as me "how do you make [these videos with all of the data](https://youtu.be/K1_plhysQgo)" often enough I figured I'd write up the process.

TL;DR - go get [RaceRender](https://racerender.com/). It's not free, but you get what you pay for.

1. I record my videos using a GoPro. This isn't the important bit though. The same process should work with an Insta360, or similar cameras.

2. I use an AIM Solo 2 DL, along with a bike specific harness, to record all of my data. This gets me gear position, speed, brake G (synthetic channel), and more.

3. I can export the AIM data once imported, from Race Studio 3. You need to make sure to select the relevant channels.

4. I use a program, RaceRender, that allows editing video and the data together. You can create your own template for your videos. They provide quite a few that also work well enough.

5. Sync the start of the race on the video and in the data. Honestly, getting the data aligned with the video is most of the work. You have to find where the lap starts. Race Render has an ability to know where the start line is, which gets you pretty close, but typically it takes some massaging to get it 'just right'.


So there it is. That's really all there is to it.
