$11,500 including all listed parts below.

This KTM 890R Duke is relatively new, 2051 miles. It's never been crashed, been cared for well, and has been well setup. I have the OEM parts if you want to revert any changes, as well as some spare parts that aren't installed yet. It's a fun motorcycle and is at home on the street or a race track.

Between what is installed and what is included, you would have enough to set this up as a race motorcycle, or just a really slick looking streetbike. this motorcycle has been dyno'd and puts out more power to the rear wheel than my 600CC Sportbike. So if powerful motorcycles with lots of torque are your thing, or if you have been thinking about going racing with WMRRA/OMRRA/MotoAmerica SuperHooligans, this could be the ticket.

At a high level, more details below, this motorcycle has a free flowing aftermarket Arrow Exhaust, a higher flowing DNA air filter and Rottweiller Intake Power Plate. It comes with a full enabled ECU with quick shifting, traction control, from KTM (Track Pack). It also has a RapidBike Race tuner installed supporting full tuning. The motorcycle was tuned at White's motorcycle service.

The controls have been upgraded to Bonamici rearsets, a G2 Billet/Bearing throttle tube and a KTM Factory +0 Seat. The rearsets are fully adjustable to fit a variety of rider heights. Frame sliders, spool sliders, wheel sliders have been added in case of a tipover. This motorcycle hasn't been crashed or dropped.

I tried to list everything that has been done below, this bike is far from OEM.
